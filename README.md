# MultiMarkdown-extension-.tmbundle-master

An MMD bundle that adds basic MMD functionality and convenience, while also trying to bring Fletcher Penneyâ€™s MMD bundle up to the world of TM2.

This takes some useful commands from [Fletcher Penney's](https://github.com/fletcher) [MMD TextMate bundle](https://github.com/fletcher/markdown.tmbundle) and makes them available for use in TextMate. This is (at present, at least) an *extension* of the official MD bundle.

**Comments, questions, suggestions, fixes, corrections certainly encouraged!**
